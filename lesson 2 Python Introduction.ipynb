The array object in NumPy is referred to as `ndarray`. NumPy arrays are several times faster than traditional Python lists. This is because (behind the scenes) NumPy is developed in C++. `ndarrays` are also more efficient with memory usage. This is because Python lists may host several types of data at the same time, whereas `ndarrays` can only host numerical data. Finally NumPy can run sub-tasks in parallel. There is in fact the possibility to vectorize operations without the need of using `for` loops to cycle through the array and performing the calculations on each single element.\n",
